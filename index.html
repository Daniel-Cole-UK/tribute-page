          <p class="text-justify small"><strong>Alan Turing</strong> was not a well known figure during his lifetime. But today he is famous for being an eccentric yet passionate British mathematician, who conceived modern computing and played a crucial part in the Allied victory
            over Nazi Germany in WW2.</p>
          <p class="text-justify small">Sadly, he was also a victim of mid-20th Century attitudes to homosexuality – he was chemically castrated before dying at the age of 41.</p>

          <p class="text-justify small">Below is a brief timeline of the events which shaped Alan's life, and sadly, those which led to it's premature end. </p>

          <p class="small">Alan joins St Michael's day school in Hastings, where he does not do very well. He is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School when he is ten where he does much better and learns to play chess.</p>
          <h3>1926</h3>
          <p class="small">Alan becomes a pupil at Sherborne School in Dorset. Alan is not interested in their traditional classical education as he really wants to spend his time doing Science and Mathematics</p>
          <h3>1927</h3>
          <p class="small">Alan becomes deeply interested in the work of Albert Einstein and is able to develop work done by Einstein based on a questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion.</p>
          <h3>1928-1930</h3>
          <p class="small">Alan enters 6th form at Sherborne and becomes great friends with Christopher Morcom, another talented boy who loves Maths and Science. While they are applying for university, Christopher suddenly dies. Alan is devastated.</p>
          <h3>1931-1934</h3>
          <p class="small">Alan becomes an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge to study Mathematics. He enjoys university and is highly successful. He graduates with distinction</p>
